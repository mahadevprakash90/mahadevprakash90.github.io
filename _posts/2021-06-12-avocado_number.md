title: "The Devil's Avocado"

It has been a rainy week in Charlotte and the lightning did very little to steal my thunder. For I did rise from my existential couch (beladen with the used clothes
of habit) and posed by the window looking skyward, contemplating society and existence during the contagion. 

I painfully had to accept the reality that I am indeed allergic to avocado. I always hoped this avocado toast will be different from the last but that was not to be.
"Why didn't we get Avocado?" asked Deepthi, making love to her guacamole. She was asking why avocado is not part of the Indian cuisine where every other food 
native to the Americas has become integral (or derivative of the Americas)- like potato, chilly pepper, yuca (tapioca) and tomatoes to name a few. So what did Indians eat before Columbus searched
for us? Lot of dal, rice, fish, and meat I guess. Nice discussion <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4rwri1/what_was_indian_food_like_before_contact_with_the/'> 
 here </a>. But still I am forever divorced from avocado. 
 
In other news, the contagion found its way back into China as the delta variant. I hope that the light at the end of the tunnel does not turn out to be a wildfire.
 People were just starting to do people again. And I hope the virus does not mutate through the entire Greek alphabet. I he(a)rd immunity was already here. On another note
, it felt really weird asking for Corona beer at the taqueria (it was well reviewed - 4/5). 

Here is a haiku to capture the essence of the week. 

"I walked into a random forest. 
The trees were lovely, dark, and deep, with randomly sampled features. 
Miles to go before I sleep."
